## MySQL SQL Techniques Used

1. **Joins**  
   - Combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

2. **Ranking and Partition**  
   - Using the `RANK()` function along with `PARTITION BY` to rank items within a subset of data.

3. **Rolling Sum**  
   - Calculating cumulative totals over a specified order of data using the `SUM()` function with `OVER()` clause.

4. **Moving Average**  
   - Using window functions to calculate averages over a specific range of data.

5. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Calculating summary statistics like `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc., to describe data characteristics.

6. **CTE (Common Table Expression)**  
   - Using `WITH` clause to define temporary result sets that can be referenced within the main query.

7. **DateTime Manipulation**  
   - Handling and formatting date and time values using functions like `DATE_FORMAT`, `MONTH`, `STR_TO_DATE`, and `HOUR`.

8. **Grouping and Sorting**  
   - Grouping data with `GROUP BY` and sorting results with `ORDER BY`.

9. **Correlation**  
   - Implementing correlation analysis (not directly supported in MySQL, requires custom implementation).

10. **Rounding**  
    - Rounding numeric values to a specified precision using `ROUND()`.

11. **Aggregation Functions**  
    - Using functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc., to aggregate data.

12. **Sub-Queries**  
    - Nesting queries within other queries to perform complex filtering and data manipulation.

13. **Other Analytical Functions**  
    - Using functions like `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and window functions for advanced analytics.

This list summarizes the MySQL-specific SQL techniques applied in the provided queries.
